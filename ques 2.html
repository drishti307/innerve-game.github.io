            <p> <br>
                Captain America  shows Sam a multiset of integers. (A multiset is a collection of elements where there can be duplicates). In every move Captain America  removes a maximum number from this multiset and divides it by 2 (integer division, which is rounded down).
If after dividing, the number is still positive (greater than 0) he re-inserts it back into the multiset.
Before the start of the game, Captain America  shows Sam the numbers in his multiset.
Captain America  asks Sam, M questions. The i-th question will be denoted by Q[i], and Sam must find the value of the number Captain America  will be dividing (before he performs the division) after Q[i]-1 moves. That is, what is the value of the number on which the Q[i]-th division is performed?
Can you help Sam and answer the queries?<br>
<br>Input
<br>•	The first line contains 2 space separated integers N, M denoting the initial size of the multiset and the number of questions respectively.
<br>•	The next line contains N space separated integers, the initial elements of the multiset.
<br>•	Of the next M lines, the i-th line will contain Q[i].
<br>Output
	<br>Output M lines, the i-th of which contains the answer for the i-th query.
<br>Constraints
<br>•	1 ≤ N, M ≤ 106
<br>•	The queries are given in chronological order. That is, Q[i] > Q[i-1]
<br>•	Every element of the multiset will be a positive integer less than 263
<br>•	It's guaranteed that the set will contain at least one element at the time of any query.
<br>Example
<br>Input:
<br>4 6
<br>8 5 3 1
<br>1
<br>2
<br>3
<br>4
<br>6
<br>8
               <br> <br>What will be the sum of EVEN answers for the above input?
