            <p> The planet Titan has the shape of a tree — there are N servers and N-1 bidirectional channels connecting pairs of servers in such a way that there is exactly one path between each pair of servers.
                Each Titan  citizen lives on exactly one server at any point in time. Each channel connecting two servers has a value called blip. Each citizen can move to a different server through channels; moving through 
                a channel with blip 2w takes w nanoseconds. 
                <br>Initially, there are ci citizens living on the i-th server (for each 1 ≤ i ≤ N).Recently, Thanos has created an Intitial Currency Offering  for Titancoin — the 
                cryptocurrency of the future in Titan. Everyone in Titan should receive exactly 1 Titancoin. 
                <br>How to organize this process? Titancoins can only be received on certain servers containing cryptoexchanges. Unfortunately, Thanos can only create cryptoexchanges
                on two servers, since they consume a lot of electric power. The citizens want to receive Titancoin as fast as possible; therefore, each citizen chooses the closest server with a cryptoexchange and moves to that server. 
                Receiving Titancoin at a cryptoexchange takes zero time.Thanos wants to minimize the sum of the times each citizen needs to spend moving to receive Titancoin. The two servers containing cryptoexchanges can be chosen 
                arbitrarily. Compute the minimum total time it takes Titan's citizens to receive Titancoin!
                <br><br>Input
                <br>	The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
                <br>	The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
                <br>	The second line contains N space-separated integers c1, c2, ..., cN.
                <br>N-1 lines follow. Each of these lines contains three space-separated integers u, v and w denoting a channel with blip 2w nanoseconds connecting servers u and v.
                <br><br>Output
                <br>For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimal sum of times it takes each citizen to receive Titancoin if the two cryptoexchanges are placed optimally.
                <br><br>Constraints<br>
